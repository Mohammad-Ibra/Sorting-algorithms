# SORTING ALGORITHMS

**Definition:**

A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of elements in the respective data structure.

**Examples of sorting algorithms:**

    1. Selection sort
    2. Bubble sort
    3. Insertion sort
    4. Merge sort
    5. Quick sort
    6. Heap sort
    7. Counting sort
    8. Radix sort

### Selection sort Algorithm

The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.

- The subarray which is already sorted. 
- Remaining subarray which is unsorted.

In every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.
